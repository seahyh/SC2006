# Welcome Message
Welcome to Team 6's SC2006 Mini-Project. This Mini-Project gave our team the opportunity to venture beyond the syllabus
and gain insightful skills & knowledge through the analysis of real world data.

We would also like to thank our TA Long Quanyu for constantly encouraging us to experiment with new methods in
approaching our problems and this Mini-Project would not have been possible without her valuable feedback and expertise
in the field of Software Engineering.
